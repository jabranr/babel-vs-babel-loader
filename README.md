# `babel` vs `babel-loader`

Investigating output from `babel` and `babel-loader` which is vastly different from each other.

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```

This will output results into `webpack/` and `babel/`.

# Objective

Publish a `React` component to `npm` as a module that can be consumed by anyone. Intended targets are `es` and `commonjs` modules.
